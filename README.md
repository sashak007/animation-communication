This chat will allow users to talk with each other using gifs! Right now this is a basic basic skeleton laying out the React components for the various elements and functionality of the chat app. Right now this is a frontend only prototype that stores a username and the user's messages within the app's state.

## Roadmap
+ Integrate with the Giphy API to make requests based on user's input.
+ Allow users to sign up to send and receive messages in real time.
+ Backend considers (still undecided):
    + A) Set up a database to store users and messages - integrate with socket.io.
    + B) Set up an account with Firebase Cloud Messaging.
